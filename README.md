# Olympic Games Database Management System

Database management system to store information about the Olympic games.

The database will contain details of the Olympic teams of each country, participating athletes and their support staff, sporting venues and spectating audiences' details. 

It also provides categorisation of tickets and events, details of accommodation and transport for participants, ranking based on sport/country, match fixtures, sponsors, and other recreational facilities for both participants and audience.

It aims to provide an efficient and secure environment for the organising committee to store, access, manage and analyse the essential information for the smooth conduct of the Olympics.
